run this locally and be your own dj, input a youtube link and press load:
- wait for the audio of the video to download
- wait for the audio to be split into different tracks:
  - vocals
  - drums
  - bass
  - other (not 1-3)

there's a basic html page for you to interact with. you can:
- pause/play all tracks
- mute certain stems
- solo certain stems

you can also download individual stems or a combination of what you want e.g. just the drums + bass
- Get individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, etc)
- Play/pause all tracks
- Control volume for each track
- Change playback speed
- Download individual stems
