# Track Separation Tool

This is a web app that splits songs into separate instrument tracks. You can:
- Input a YouTube URL
- Get individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, etc)
- Play/pause all tracks
- Control volume for each track
- Change playback speed
- Download individual stems

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies (check requirements.txt)
3. Run the server
4. Open in your browser

That's pretty much it. Have fun splitting tracks.
